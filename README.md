# Arc reactor clock controller
- The controller is based on Nodejs (socket.io)
- The clock and arduino code is based on <b>jeje95</b> product on Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6063303)
- To use this, please install the included libraries:

```
npm install
```
for Arduino, just follow most of <b>jeje95</b>'s instructions (I used different library to manipulate JSON so please check the source code)
